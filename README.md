## Technologies Used

- **SASS**: Used for writing structured and modular CSS.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **CSS Animations**: To create dynamic transitions and effects.
- **Autoprefixer**: Ensures cross-browser compatibility by automatically adding vendor prefixes.
- **NPM**: Used for dependency management (e.g., autoprefixer).

## Features

- **Full-page navigation** with a clickable fixed nav icon.
- **Text slide-in animations** using the `transform` property.
- **Pure CSS popup box** created with the `target` pseudo-class and a checkbox.
- **Button hover animations** for enhanced interactivity.
- **Card flip animation** showing the back of the card when hovered.
- **Background video section** with a fluid layout.
- **CSS `clip-path`** to clip sections dynamically.
- **Skewed sections** for creating unique visual effects.
- **Responsive image handling** based on resolution and density switching techniques.
- **Custom checkbox styling** from scratch.
- **Form styling**, including placeholders using CSS pseudo-classes.
  
## File Structure

5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the website.
```
## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I learned and explored the following concepts in CSS and SASS:

- **Advanced CSS properties**: Mastering text slide-in effects, hover animations, and more.
- **CSS Animations**: Created engaging animations, such as card flipping and button hover effects.
- **CSS `clip-path`**: Used for clipping sections and creating creative layouts.
- **Pseudo-classes**: Used `:not` to target non-hovered items and other pseudo-classes like `:placeholder-shown`.
- **Building a custom checkbox** and styling forms with advanced CSS.
- **Media Queries in SASS**: Built responsive designs that adapt across screen sizes.
- **Art Direction and Image Optimization**: Learned how to use responsive images to optimize load times across various screen resolutions.

## Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices, including tablets and mobile phones. 

**Image Responsiveness**: Using resolution changing and density switching techniques, I optimized images to load in different resolutions based on the device, reducing loading times and ensuring that users only download the necessary image sizes.

## Credits

This project was built as a personal learning resource, so no external libraries or frameworks were used other than the required NPM packages.

Feel free to check out the project live and see how all these CSS techniques come together in action!
